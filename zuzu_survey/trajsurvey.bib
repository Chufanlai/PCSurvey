	of urban traffic congestion based on GPS trajectories. For these
	trajectories we develop strategies to extract and derive traffic
	jam information. After cleaning the trajectories, they are matched
	to a road network. Subsequently, traffic speed on each road segment
	is computed and traffic jam events are automatically detected. Spatially
	and temporally related events are concatenated in, so-called, traffic
	jam propagation graphs. These graphs form a high-level description
	of a traffic jam and its propagation in time and space. Our system
	provides multiple views for visually exploring and analyzing the
	traffic condition of a large city as a whole, on the level of propagation
	graphs, and on road segment level. Case studies with 24 days of taxi
	GPS trajectories collected in Beijing demonstrate the effectiveness
	of our system.},

	up opportunities to inform both policy and administration and thereby
	help governments improve the lives of their citizens, increase the
	efficiency of public services, and reduce the environmental harms
	of development. However, cities are complex systems and exploring
	the data they generate is challenging. The interaction between the
	various components in a city creates complex dynamics where interesting
	facts occur at multiple scales, requiring users to inspect a large
	number of data slices over time and space. Manual exploration of

	In this paper, we propose a technique that supports event-guided
	exploration of large, spatio-temporal urban data. We model the data
	as time-varying scalar functions and use computational topology to
	automatically identify events in different data slices. To handle
	a potentially large number of events, we develop an algorithm to
	group and index them, thus allowing users to interactively explore
	and query event patterns on the fly. A visual exploration interface
	helps guide users towards data slices that display interesting events
	and trends. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on

	to monitor and inspect data interactively from three levels (region,

	the region view of our system, global temporal changes in spatial
	evolution will be presented to users and can be interactively explored.
	The road view shows temporal changes to the traffic situations of
	significant segments of roads. The vehicle view uses a novel visualization
	method to track individual vehicles. Furthermore, the three views
	integrate important statistical and historical information related
	to traffic, which illustrate temporal changes of the traffic. We
	find that this design can help users explore historical information

	a novel approach to visualizing trajectory attribute data. Our solution
	covers space, time, and attribute values. Based on an analysis of
	relevant visualization tasks, we designed the visualization solution
	around the principle of stacking trajectory bands. The core of our
	approach is a hybrid 2D/3D display. A 2D map serves as a reference
	for the spatial context, and the trajectories are visualized as stacked
	3D trajectory bands along which attribute values are encoded by color.
	Time is integrated through appropriate ordering of bands and through
	a dynamic query mechanism that feeds temporally aggregated information
	to a circular time display. An additional 2D time graph shows temporal
	information in full detail by stacking 2D trajectory bands. Our solution
	is equipped with analytical and interactive mechanisms for selecting
	and ordering of trajectories, and adjusting the color mapping, as
	well as coordinated highlighting and dedicated 3D navigation. We
	demonstrate the usefulness of our novel visualization by three examples
	related to radiation surveillance, traffic analysis, and maritime

  abstract = {A major difficulty in the analysis of disaggregate activity-travel
	behavior in the past arises from the many interacting dimensions
	involved (e.g. location, timing, duration and sequencing of trips
	and activities). Often, the researcher is forced to decompose activity-travel
	patterns into their component dimensions and focus only on one or
	two dimensions at a time, or to treat them as a multidimensional
	whole using multivariate methods to derive generalized activity-travel
	patterns. This paper describes several GIS-based three-dimensional
	(3D) geovisualization methods for dealing with the spatial and temporal
	dimensions of human activity-travel patterns at the same time while
	avoiding the interpretative complexity of multivariate pattern generalization
	or recognition methods. These methods are operationalized using interactive
	D GIS techniques and a travel diary data set collected in the Portland
	(Oregon) metropolitan region. The study demonstrates several advantages
	in using these methods. First, significance of the temporal dimension
	and its interaction with the spatial dimension in structuring the
	daily space-time trajectories of individuals can be clearly revealed.
	Second, they are effective tools for the exploratory analysis of
	activity diary data that can lead to more focused analysis in later
	stages of a study. They can also help the formulation of more realistic
	computational or behavioral travel models.},

  abstract = {At the end of the sixties HÃ¤gerstrand introduced a space-time model
	which included features such as a Space-Time- Path, and a Space-Time-Prism.
	His model is often seen as the start of the time-geography studies.
	Throughout the years his model has been applied and improved to understand
	our movements through space. Problems studied can be found in different
	fields of geography, and range from those on an individual movement
	to whole theories to optimize transportation. From a visualization
	perspective the Space-Time-Cube was the most prominent element in
	Hagerstrand's approach. In its basic appearance these images consist
	of a cube with on its base a representation of geography (along the
	x- and y-axis), while the cube's height represents time (z-axis).
	A typical Space-Time-Cube could contain the space time-paths of for
	instance individuals or bus routes. However, when the concept was
	introduced the options to create the graphics were limited to manual
	methods and the user could only experience the single view created
	by the draftsperson. An alternative view on the cube would mean to
	go through a laborious drawing exercise. Today's software has options
	to automatically create the cube and its contents from a database.
	Data acquisition of space-time paths for both individuals and groups
	is also made easier using GPS. Today, the user's viewing environment
	is, by default, interactive and allows one to view the cube from
	any direction. In this paper an extended interactive and dynamic
	visualization environment is proposed, and demonstrated, in which
	the user has full flexibility to view, manipulate and query the data
	in a Space-Time-Cube. Included are options to move slider planes
	along each of the axes to for instance select, or highlight a period
	in time or location in space. Examples will be discussed in which
	the time axis is manipulated by for instance changing world time
	for event time (time cartograms). Creativity should not stop here
	since it has been shown that especially an alternative perspective
	on the data will sparkle the mind with new ideas. The user should
	be allowed to for instance let the x- and/or y-axis be represented
	by other variables of the theme studied. Since the cube is seen as
	an integral part of a geovisualization environment the option to
	link other views with other graphic representation does exist.},

	systems (GIS) presents a challenging research topic. Recent developments
	of information and communication technologies (ICT), which enable
	a virtual space and allow people to interact with others remotely,
	make such efforts even more difficult. This paper first extends the
	spaceâtime path concept of HÃ¤gerstrand's time geography to represent
	both physical and virtual activities in a spaceâtime context. A spatio-temporal
	GIS design which can accommodate the extended spaceâtime path concept
	is proposed to support the exploration of spatio-temporal patterns
	of human interactions in physical and virtual spaces. Using time
	as a linear referencing system, a temporal dynamic segmentation method
	was developed to dynamically locate physical and virtual activities
	on spaceâtime paths. The GIS design supports the identification of
	four different spatio-temporal patterns (i.e., co-existence, co-location
	in space, co-location in time, and no co-location in either space
	or time) of human interactions through their spaceâtime paths. Using
	a hypothetical activity dataset, a prototype system is implemented
	as a three-dimensional GIS (i.e., two-dimensional space + one-dimensional
	time) in ArcGIS. The prototype system demonstrates the feasibility
	and potential of applying spatio-temporal GIS concepts to extend
	Hagerstrand's timeâgeographic framework for the representation and
	analysis of human interactions in both physical and virtual spaces.
	The proposed GIS design can be useful in such applications as understanding

	Bremm at al. [18] suggest a visualization technique showing temporal
	variation of object presence at different locations and flows between
	the locations on a particular kind of temporal display where the
	locations are represented by distinct colouring (this can work well
	for a relatively small number of different locations). The technique
	is demonstrated in Fig. 7D; the map in Fig. 7C shows the territory
	division and colours of the areas that are used in Fig. 7D. To build
	this display, the trajectories of the ships have been aligned in
	time to a common starting time, as mentioned in section 2.3. Then
	the transformed time has been divided into hourly intervals. For
	each time interval, the display contains a bar divided into coloured
	segments proportionally to the number of moving objects that visited
	the areas in this interval. Grey is used for unknown positions. In
	this particular example, grey segments represent the trajectories
	that ended before the respective time intervals. Aggregated transitions
	between the areas are represented by bands drawn between the bars.
	The widths of the bands are proportional to the counts of the objects
	that moved. Gradient colouring is applied to the bands so that the
	left end is painted in the colour of the origin area and the right
	end in the colour of the destination area, or in grey for the trajectories
	that ended.
	
	
	By interacting with the display, it is possible to explore not only
	direct transitions between areas but also longer sequences of visited
	areas. When the user clicks on a bar segment, the movements of the
	corresponding subset of objects are highlighted in the display (i.e.,
	shown by brighter colours). This is illustrated in Fig. 7D. By clicking
	on the green segment of the fifth bar, the user has selected the
	subset of ships that were in the area of Amsterdam in the fifth hour
	since the beginning of their movement. We can see the previous and
	past locations of the selected ships and when the transitions occurred.
	Analogously, the user can click on a band connecting segments to
	select the objects participating in the respective transitions and
	trace their movements.},

	situations of significant spots of a city. These fingerprints integrate
	important statistical and historical information related to traffic
	and can be conveniently embedded into urban maps. The sophisticated

	in flow mapping, proposes an approach to mapping a large migration

	Even with an acceptable level of generalisation, such as the flow
	density surfaces of Rae (2009), density of flow lines does not necessarily
	indicate the density of origin and destination locations and can
	result in arbitrary patterns of flow density. The suitability for
	flow line density will depend on the importance attached to the path
	of the trajectory connecting origin and destination.
	
	It is important to appreciate that a conventional flow map or flow
	density surface (e.g. Rae, 2009) can produce such arbitrary variations
	in line density that do not reflect the true distributions of OD

	It is a challenging task to visualize such data and discover network

	In the latter, the goal is automated adaptation of the system to
	meet user needs for applications such as mobile location-based services

	data often involve uncertainty due to inadequate sampling rates and

	be accurately reconstructed. In this paper, we investigate the uncertainty
	problem in trajectory data and present a visual analytics system

	samples. We first propose two novel visual encoding schemes called
	the road map analyzer and the uncertainty lens for discovering road
	map errors and visually analyzing the uncertainty in trajectory data
	respectively. Then, we conduct three case studies to discover the
	map errors, to address the ambiguity problem in map-matching, and
	to reconstruct the trajectories with historical data. These case
	studies demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of our system.},

	[Comments from BOZ]
	
	APT [26] is an automated graphic presentation tool that designs static,
	2D presentations of relational information. A significant contribution
	of APT was to formally characterize something to which many previous
	investigators informally alluded. Graphic presentations can be expressed
	as sentences in formal graphical languages that have the same precise
	syntax and semantics as propositional formalisms. The advantage of
	having a formalism for graphic presentations is that it provides
	a set of criteria for deciding the role of each visible sign or symbol
	placed in a graphic and improves the integrity of a graphic presentation
	by using formal methods for transforming logical facts to graphical
	facts. APT's style of analysis for formal graphical languages has
	been used by nearly every graphic presentation tool designed after
	APT, including the one described in this paper. A second contribution
	of APT is that, unlike proposals for graphic design practices, APT
	designs graphics with a minimum amount of intervention on the part
	of the designer; that is, APT embodies a genuinely prescriptive theory
	of how to design a graphic. However, APT?? design algorithm is based
	on an analysis of the information to be presented and does not explicitly
	consider the task for which a graphic is to be used. This prevents
	APT from directly exploiting the task-related advantages of graphics
	and from creating different presentations of the same information
	to support different tasks.
	
	
	[Comments from Show Me]
	
	Mackinlay's APT system is the foundational work on the automatic design
	of graphical presentations of relational information [7]. He codified
	Bertin's semiology of graphics as algebraic operators that were used
	to search for effective presentations of information [1].},

  volume = {15},

  abstract = {Spatiotemporal analysis of sensor logs is a challenging research field
	due to three facts: a) traditional two-dimensional maps do not support
	multiple events to occur at the same spatial location, b) three-dimensional
	solutions introduce ambiguity and are hard to navigate, and c) map
	distortions to solve the overlap problem are unfamiliar to most users.
	This paper introduces a novel approach to represent spatial data
	changing over time by plotting a number of non-overlapping pixels,
	close to the sensor positions in a map. Thereby, we encode the amount
	of time that a subject spent at a particular sensor to the number
	of plotted pixels. Color is used in a twofold manner; while distinct
	colors distinguish between sensor nodes in different regions, the
	colors' intensity is used as an indicator to the temporal property
	of the subjects' activity. The resulting visualization technique,
	called growth ring maps, enables users to find similarities and extract
	patterns of interest in spatiotemporal data by using humans' perceptual
	abilities. We demonstrate the newly introduced technique on a dataset
	that shows the behavior of healthy and Alzheimer transgenic, male
	and female mice. We motivate the new technique by showing that the
	temporal analysis based on hierarchical clustering and the spatial
	analysis based on transition matrices only reveal limited results.
	Results and findings are cross-validated using multidimensional scaling.
	While the focus of this paper is to apply our visualization for monitoring
	animal behavior, the technique is also applicable for analyzing data,

	Bak et al. [14] represent presence of moving objects at different
	locations without explicit spatial aggregation. Each visit is represented
	on a map by a pixel coloured according to the time of the visit or
	value of some attribute. The pixels are arranged in a spiral layout
	around the locations so that identically coloured pixels are placed
	closely to each other. As a result, a circle emerges around a location
	in which pixels with same colours form rings; the technique is therefore
	called Growth Rings. The layout induces perceptual aggregation: the
	user does not distinguish individual pixels but perceives them all
	together as one figure. The size of the whole figure shows the total
	number of visits while the rings show the proportions of occurrences
	of the attribute values encoded by the colours.},

  abstract = {The technology available to building designers now makes it possible
	to monitor buildings on a very large scale. Video cameras and motion
	sensors are commonplace in practically every office space, and are
	slowly making their way into living spaces. The application of such
	technologies, in particular video cameras, while improving security,
	also violates privacy. On the other hand, motion sensors, while being
	privacy-conscious, typically do not provide enough information for
	a human operator to maintain the same degree of awareness about the
	space that can be achieved by using video cameras. We propose a novel
	approach in which we use a large number of simple motion sensors
	and a small set of video cameras to monitor a large office space.
	In our system we deployed 215 motion sensors and six video cameras
	to monitor the 3,000-square-meter office space occupied by 80 people
	for a
	
	period of about one year. The main problem in operating such systems
	is finding a way to present this highly multidimensional data, which
	includes both spatial and temporal components, to a human operator
	to allow browsing and searching recorded data in an efficient and
	intuitive way.
	
	In this paper we present our experiences and the solutions that we
	have developed in the course of our work on the system. We consider
	this work to be the first step in helping designers and managers
	of building systems gain access to information about occupants' behavior
	in the context of an entire building in a way that is only minimally
	intrusive to the occupants' privacy.},

	Multiple Methods Through a Long-Term Case Study},

  abstract = {Working with three domain specialists we investigate human-centered
	approaches to geovisualization following an ISO13407 taxonomy covering
	context of use, requirements and early stages of design. Our case
	study, undertaken over three years, draws attention to repeating
	trends: that generic approaches fail to elicit adequate requirements
	for geovis application design; that the use of real data is key to
	understanding needs and possibilities; that trust and knowledge must
	be built and developed with collaborators. These processes take time
	but modified human-centred approaches can be effective. A scenario
	developed through contextual inquiry but supplemented with domain
	data and graphics is useful to geovis designers. Wireframe, paper
	and digital prototypes enable successful communication between specialist
	and geovis domains when incorporating real and interesting data,
	prompting exploratory behaviour and eliciting previously unconsidered
	requirements. Paper prototypes are particularly successful at eliciting
	suggestions, especially for novel visualization. Enabling specialists
	to explore their data freely with a digital prototype is as effective
	as using a structured task protocol and is easier to administer.
	Autoethnography has potential for framing the design process. We
	conclude that a common understanding of context of use, domain data
	and visualization possibilities are essential to successful geovis
	design and develop as this progresses. HC approaches can make a significant
	contribution here. However, modified approaches, applied with flexibility,
	are most promising. We advise early, collaborative engagement with
	data - through simple, transient visual artefacts supported by data
	sketches and existing designs - before moving to successively more
	sophisticated data wireframes and data prototypes.},

  abstract = {In motorsports there are typically long race tracks with the result
	that the racecarsâ positions can not be surveyed easily. Professional
	motorsports series â such as the famous Formula 1 â introduced car
	tracking visualizations where the position of each participant is

	series, in amateur motorsports dense data, which is crucial for accurate
	tracking, is often not acquired. In our paper, we present ideas that
	allow car tracking that is informative and visually pleasing using
	sparser data. To this end, we propose different strategies for data
	integration as well as for interpolation and approximation, respectively,
	and introduce a visualization that displays the inevitable uncertainty

  abstract = {Trajectory data are increasingly becoming available to researchers
	due to the advances in technologies like GPS, RFID, and wireless
	communication devices. Mining or analyzing trajectory data is important
	in many different applications such as transportation management,
	mobility study, route suggestion, and mobile communication management.
	However, as trajectory data contain both spatial and temporal attributes
	and are often huge in size and high in dimensionality, trajectory
	data analysis is a very challenging task. Visual analytics solutions
	show great potential as they can intuitively present multidimensional
	spatio-temporal trajectory data and provide rich interactions, allowing
	users to explore the data and improve mining processes and results.
	In this survey, we first introduce the research problem and summarize
	key challenges in the visual analysis of trajectories. Then we continue
	with some background knowledge on trajectory data including data
	characteristics, collection, processing, and calibration. After that
	we summarize typical trajectory analysis methods, related visual
	presentations, and interactive system frameworks. Major visualization
	techniques for trajectories will be reviewed and discussed in the
	following section. Then we present state-of-the-art applications
	such as transportation management, mobility intelligence of drivers,
